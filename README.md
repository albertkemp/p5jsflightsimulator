# p5jsflightsimulator
A flight simulator made using the p5.js library

# About
This flight simulator is currently complete, and although it isn't the best I would say I'm done as there aren't any major bugs. The project is a 2D flight simulator using the JavaScript library of P5js, which I recommend for running simple interactive programs using JavaScript.

This flight simulator is quite nice and can be found at <a href="https://albertkemp.github.io/p5jsflightsimulator">https://albertkemp.github.io/p5jsflightsimulator</a>.
